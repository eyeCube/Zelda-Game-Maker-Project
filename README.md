# Zelda-Game-Maker-Project

This is a very old project which I have long since abandoned, but I worked on it for a long time, and learned a lot. It was in many ways my first serious, large project, and it taught me so much about good gameplay design.

Unfortunately this game is not exactly playable right now, but if anyone has any serious interest in the project I can try to revive it. There is one mostly-completed dungeon with a couple of decent puzzles, and the gameplay is all right for the most part, though sometimes it's super janky. The cool part of this game was the Goddess essences: Din's, Farore's, and Nayru's, which granted you fire, wind/earth, and ice/electricity magic, respectively. You could do cool things like power up your sword with fire (Din) or gain super speed (Farore) or shock enemies with your sword (Nayru); and there was a magic rod that changed its magic spell from fireballs to ice balls with Nayru, and Farore with the magic rod did something that I can't quite remember.
